class Edge():
	"""
	A class that represents a line with a fixed distance between two points.

	Attributes
	----------
	Point1 : Point
		The first point of the edge.
	Point2 : Point
		The second point of the edge.

	Args
	----------
	Point1 : Point
		The first point of the edge.
	Point2 : Point
		The second point of the edge.
	
	Methods
	-------
	is_point_on_edge(point, tolerance) -> bool
		Checks whether a point is on an edge (on the connection line between the two edge points).



    We need a Line() class and an Edge() class because converting 
    from an Edge to a Line is Possible but not the other way around.
	The "converting" from Edge to m and n is done on demand by the m and n properties.
